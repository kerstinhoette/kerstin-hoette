# Personal site (two-page)

- `index.html` — home with photo, links to Google Scholar and ORCID, and nav to Publications.
- `publications.html` — publications list parsed from CV (best-effort). If parsing failed, it links to CV/Scholar/ORCID.
- `cv.pdf` — current CV.

## Add your real photo
Replace `me.jpg` in the repo root with your headshot (ideally a square 800×800).

## Deploy
Upload all files to your GitHub Pages repo (user site or project site).
